# **Lecture 1: Introduction to Time Series**

## **What is a Time Series?**  
- **Definition**: A time series is data observed over time where observations depend on the time order.  
- **Difference from other data**:  
  - Unlike data in classical inference (e.g., regression, hypothesis testing), time series data is **not independent**.  
  - In classical datasets, observations are i.i.d (**Independent and Identically Distributed**).  
  - In time series:
    - Observations are **chronological**.
    - **Dependencies exist** between data points due to time factors.

## **Example: Difference Between Random Variables and Time Series Data**  

1. **Random Variables**:  
   - Example: Outcomes of rolling a die \( (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{100}) \).  
   - Observations are **independent**; no pattern exists between outcomes.  

2. **Time Series**:  
   - Example: Closing prices of a stock \( (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{100}) \).  
   - Observations are **dependent**:  
     - Stock prices follow patterns over time.  
     - \( X_3 \) depends on \( X_2 \), and so on.

## **Key Characteristics of Time Series Data**  

1. **Ordered Observations**:  
   - Example: \( X_t, X_{t+1}, \dots, X_{t+10} \) follow a sequence in time.  
   - Observations depend on time \( t \).  

2. **Timeframe Notation**:  
   - Time intervals can vary:  
     - **Daily**  
     - **Weekly**  
     - **Monthly**  
     - **Annually**  

3. **Comparison with Classical Data**:  
   - **Classical Data**:  
     - Independent observations from a distribution (e.g., **Normal, Binomial**).  
   - **Time Series Data**:  
     - Observations are **dependent** on time.

## **Types of Data**  

### **1. Cross-Sectional Data**  
   - Observations collected from different entities at a **single point in time**.  
   - Examples:  
     - Maximum humidity levels at 20 locations on a particular day.  
     - Closing stock prices of 20 stocks on a particular day.  
     - Heights of students measured on a particular day.  

### **2. Time Series Data**  
   - Observations collected for a **single entity over a period of time**.  
   - Examples:  
     - Daily maximum humidity levels for a month.  
     - Closing stock price of a company over 6 months.  
     - Quarterly student enrollment in a college over 5 years.  

### **3. Panel Data (Longitudinal Data)**  
   - Combination of **cross-sectional** and **time series** data.  
   - Observations are collected for **different entities over time**.  
   - Examples:  
     - Annual cancer mortality rates of Indian states (2015–2023).  
     - Yearly sales of 10 companies over 10 years.  
     - Daily maximum temperatures of 5 cities in India over a year.

## **Steps in Analyzing Time Series Data**  

1. **Plot the Data**  
   - Visualize data to identify **patterns and trends**.  
   - Example: Google stock prices over time.  
   - Insights:  
     - **Trends**: Upward/downward movement.  
     - **Stagnation or repetition** patterns.  

2. **Study Past Behavior**  
   - Analyze **historical data** to understand trends and behaviors.  

3. **Identify Patterns and Trends**  
   - Look for:  
     - **Upward/downward trends**.  
     - **Seasonal or cyclical patterns**.  
     - **Repetitions**.  

4. **Use Past Data for Forecasting**  
   - Forecast future values based on historical data.  
   - Example: Predict **Google stock prices for the next 10 days**.

## **Applications of Time Series Analysis**  

1. **Retail Stores**  
   - Forecast **daily, monthly, or annual sales**.  

2. **Energy Companies**  
   - Predict **reserves, production, demand, supply, and prices**.  

3. **Educational Institutions**  
   - Forecast **student enrollment** for upcoming semesters or years.  

4. **International Financial Organizations**  
   - Forecast **inflation** or other economic activities.  

5. **Transportation Companies**  
   - Predict **travel demand** for specific seasons or periods.  

6. **Banks and Lending Institutions**  
   - Forecast **new home purchases**.  

7. **Venture Capital Firms**  
   - Evaluate **market potential and business plans**.  

8. **Weather Forecasting**  
   - Predict **precipitation, temperature, humidity, etc.**
