# Lecture 4: Weak Vs. Strong Stationarity

## **Definition**  
A time series is **stationary** if its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocovariance) remain constant over time.

### **Types of Stationarity**
1. **Strong Stationarity**: The joint distribution of the process is time-invariant.
2. **Weak Stationarity (Covariance Stationarity)**: Requires only the mean and autocovariance to be constant over time:
   - Constant mean.
   - Constant variance.
   - Autocovariance depends only on the lag, not time.

---

## **Weak Stationarity**
- Also known as **covariance stationarity** or **stationarity in a wide sense**.
- A time series is said to be **covariance stationary** if its first and second-order moments are unaffected by a change in the time origin.
- This leads to the following properties.

### **Properties**
- **Mean function is constant**:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[Y_t] = \mu_Y = \text{constant}
  \]
- **Variance function is constant**:  
  \[
  \text{Var}(Y_t) = \sigma_Y^2 = \text{constant}
  \]
- **Covariance and correlation depend only on lag \( k \), not time \( t \)**:  
  \[
  \text{Cov}(Y_t, Y_{t+k}) = \gamma(k)
  \]

---

## **Examples and Analysis**

### **Example 1: \( Y_t = e_t \)**
- \( e_t \) is an i.i.d. sequence with \( \mathbb{E}[e_t] = 0 \) and \( \text{Var}(e_t) = \sigma^2 \).

#### **Analysis**
- **Mean**:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[Y_t] = \mathbb{E}[e_t] = 0 \quad \text{(constant)}
  \]
- **Variance**:  
  \[
  \text{Var}(Y_t) = \text{Var}(e_t) = \sigma^2 \quad \text{(constant)}
  \]
- **Covariance**:  
  \[
  \text{Cov}(e_t, e_{t+k}) = 0, \quad k \neq 0 \quad \text{(independent errors)}
  \]

#### **Conclusion**
\( Y_t = e_t \) is **stationary**.

---

### **Example 2: \( Y_t = e_t + 0.5e_{t-1} \)**

#### **Key Steps**
- **Mean**:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[Y_t] = \mathbb{E}[e_t] + 0.5\mathbb{E}[e_{t-1}] = 0
  \]
- **Variance**:  
  \[
  \text{Var}(Y_t) = \text{Var}(e_t) + 0.25\text{Var}(e_{t-1}) + 2 \cdot \text{Cov}(e_t, e_{t-1})
  \]
  Since \( e_t \) is i.i.d,  
  \[
  \text{Var}(Y_t) = \sigma^2 + 0.25\sigma^2 = 1.25\sigma^2
  \]
- **Covariance**: Requires validation; left as an exercise.

#### **Conclusion**
\( Y_t = e_t + 0.5e_{t-1} \) is **stationary**.

---

### **Example 3: \( Y_t = \sum_{i=1}^t e_i \)**

#### **Key Observations**
- **Mean**:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[Y_t] = \sum_{i=1}^t \mathbb{E}[e_i] = 0
  \]
  (constant, but not meaningful for stationarity)
- **Variance**:  
  \[
  \text{Var}(Y_t) = \sum_{i=1}^t \text{Var}(e_i) = t\sigma^2
  \]
  (not constant, depends on \( t \))

#### **Conclusion**
\( Y_t \) is **not stationary** because variance depends on \( t \).

---

### **Example 4: \( Y_t = a + bt + e_t \)**

#### **Key Observations**
- **Mean**:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[Y_t] = a + bt + \mathbb{E}[e_t] = a + bt
  \]
  (not constant, depends on \( t \))
- **Variance**:  
  \[
  \text{Var}(Y_t) = \text{Var}(e_t) = \sigma^2
  \]
  (constant)

#### **Conclusion**
\( Y_t \) is **not stationary** because the mean depends on \( t \).

## **Comparison: Strong vs. Weak Stationarity**
| Property              | **Strong Stationarity** | **Weak Stationarity** |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Definition**       | Joint distributions are time-invariant | Mean and autocovariance are constant |
| **Mean Requirement** | Not required to be constant | Must be constant |
| **Variance Requirement** | Not required to be finite | Must be finite |
| **Covariance Requirement** | Full distribution invariance | Autocovariance depends only on lag \( k \) |

### **Key Observation**
- If a process \( X_t \) follows a **Gaussian distribution**, weak stationarity **implies** strong stationarity.  
- This is because a **multivariate normal distribution** is fully determined by its first two moments (mean and variance).

---

## **Practical Notes**
- In real-world applications, most observed time series are **non-stationary** due to trends, seasonality, or other patterns.
- Common transformations to achieve stationarity:
  - **Differencing**: \( \Delta Y_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1} \)
  - **Detrending**: Removing a trend component \( bt \).
  - **Log transformation**: \( \log(Y_t) \) to stabilize variance.
- Unless explicitly stated, the term **"stationary"** typically refers to **weak stationarity**.
