# **Lecture 6: Time Series Decomposition**

## **Time Series Decomposition**
### **Definition**
Time series decomposition involves breaking a time series into its fundamental components.

## **Introduction to Basic Time Series Models**
1. **Auto-regressive (AR)**
2. **Moving Average (MA)**
3. **Random Walk**

## **Time Series Decomposition**

### **Purpose**
A time series, denoted as \( Y_t \), can be decomposed into four main components:  

1. **Trend Component (\( T_t \))**: Represents the long-term movement, also known as the **secular trend**.  
2. **Seasonal Component (\( S_t \))**: Captures periodic variations within a cycle of **≤1 year**, also called **seasonality**.  
3. **Cyclical Component (\( C_t \))**: Describes gradual and long-term **up-and-down** movements in a cycle **>1 year**.  
4. **Random/Irregular Component (\( I_t \))**: Captures unpredictable noise and fluctuations.  

A time series is typically modeled as either:  

- **Additive Model**:  
  \[
  Y_t = T_t + S_t + C_t + I_t
  \]  

- **Multiplicative Model**:  
  \[
  Y_t = T_t \times S_t \times C_t \times I_t
  \]  

The choice between these depends on whether the seasonal and cyclical variations are independent of the trend (additive) or proportional to the trend (multiplicative).

## **Systematic vs. Random Components**

### **Systematic Components**
**Include**:  
- **Trend (\( T_t \))**  
- **Seasonality (\( S_t \))**  
- **Cyclicality (\( C_t \))**  

**Characteristics**:  
- Arise from **permanent causes** and are **predictable**.  

**Examples**:  
- **Trend**: Long-term stock price movements.  
- **Seasonality**: Temperature changes over months.  

**Forecasting**:  
- These components **help in prediction**, as they follow identifiable patterns.  

### **Random Component (\( I_t \))**
**Include**:  
- **Noise or irregular fluctuations**  

**Characteristics**:  
- Caused by entirely **random fluctuations**.  
- No discernible pattern or repetition.  
- **Unpredictable** in nature.

## **Details of Components**

### **1. Trend Component (\( T_t \))**
- Represents **long-term movement** over time.  
- Observed over an **extended period**.  
- Captures **changes in the mean level**.  

### **2. Seasonal Component (\( S_t \))**
- Regular, **periodic** variation within a **cycle ≤1 year**.  

#### **Example**
- **Monthly temperature data**:  
  - **Peaks**: Summers (e.g., June/July).  
  - **Troughs**: Winters (e.g., December/January).  

**Key Attribute**:  
- **Fixed cycle period ≤1 year**.  

### **3. Cyclical Component (\( C_t \))**
- **Long-term** fluctuations with a **cycle >1 year**.  
- **Less regular** than seasonal patterns.  

#### **Difference from Seasonality**
- **Seasonality**: Fixed, **calendar-based cycles** (e.g., yearly temperature changes).  
- **Cyclicality**: **Irregular** and longer-term movements (e.g., business cycles).  

### **4. Random/Irregular Component (\( I_t \))**
- Represents **noise or unpredictable fluctuations**.  
- **No predictable structure**.

## **Understanding Cyclicality**

### **Definition**
Cyclicality refers to **long-term fluctuations** in a time series with a duration of **at least 2 years**.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Not at regular intervals** (unlike seasonality).  

### **Example: Business Cycle**
- Economic performance moves in **waves**:  
  - **Boom (Peak)**  
  - **Recession (Trough)**  

The **next peak** may not be **as high** as the previous one, and the **next trough** may differ in depth.  

### **Key Difference from Seasonality**
- **Seasonality**: Regular, **calendar-based** repetition.  
- **Cyclicality**: **Irregular duration and amplitude**.

## **Random Variations**

### **Definition**
The **random component**, denoted as \( I_t \), refers to **unpredictable** fluctuations.  

### **Mathematical Representation**
\[
Y_t = T_t + S_t + C_t + I_t
\]  

### **Role in Time Series**
- Considered **"noise"** in the dataset.  
- Often **removed** to focus on systematic components.

## **Example: Nottingham Monthly Temperature Data**

### **Dataset**
- **Location**: Nottingham Castle, UK.  
- **Period**: 1920–1940 (20 years).  

### **Observations**
- **Seasonality dominates**: Clear peaks in summer and troughs in winter.  
- **Trend is absent**: No major long-term movement.  
- **Decomposition**:  
  - **Original Data** (Top row).  
  - **Seasonal Component** (Regular periodic variations).  
  - **Trend Component** (Flat trend).  
  - **Random Component** (Irregular fluctuations).

## **Decomposition Overview**

### **1. Trend**
**Definition**:  
\[
T_t = \text{long-term movement in the mean level}
\]  
**Example**:  
- **Stock prices** increasing over decades.  

### **2. Seasonality**
**Definition**:  
\[
S_t = \text{systematic, calendar-linked effects}
\]  
**Examples**:  
- Increased **sales during festive seasons**.  
- **Higher water consumption** in summer.  

### **3. Cyclicality**
**Definition**:  
\[
C_t = \text{long-term expansions and contractions}
\]  
**Examples**:  
- **Business cycles** (economic recessions and booms).  
- **Population growth cycles** in ecology.  

### **4. Random Component**
**Definition**:  
\[
I_t = \text{unpredictable noise}
\]  
**Example**:  
- **Stock market volatility** without pattern.

## **Examples of Dominance in Time Series**

1. **Trend Dominance**  
   - **Example**: Steady rise in **housing prices**.  
2. **Seasonality Dominance**  
   - **Example**: **Temperature fluctuations** by month.  
3. **Cyclicality Dominance**  
   - **Example**: **Business cycles** of expansion and recession.  
4. **Random Dominance**  
   - **Example**: Short-term **market volatility**.

## **Conclusion**

Time series decomposition helps identify the **dominant component** in a dataset.  

- If **trend dominates**, focus on long-term growth analysis.  
- If **seasonality dominates**, use seasonal models for forecasting.  
- If **cyclicality dominates**, study long-term economic/market trends.  
- If **randomness dominates**, the data is highly **unpredictable**.  

This understanding improves **forecasting, decision-making, and modeling** in time series analysis.
