# Lecture 9: ACF and PACF for Some Time Series Processes

## Recap of Previous Lecture
- Discussed properties of the AR(1) process (Auto-Regressive Process of Order 1).
- Assumed stationarity (constant mean and variance).
- Derived variance of the AR(1) process:  
  \[
  \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2_e}{1 - \phi_1^2}
  \]

## Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of AR(1)
- Derived ACF function for AR(1) process.
- Covariance at lag 1:  
  \[
  \gamma_1 = \mathbb{E}[Y_t Y_{t-1}]
  \]
- Under assumption of zero mean:  
  \[
  \gamma_k = \phi_1^k \gamma_0
  \]
- ACF is obtained as:  
  \[
  \rho_k = \phi_1^k
  \]

## Simulation of AR(1) Process
- Simulated an AR(1) process with coefficient \( \phi_1 = 0.6 \).
- The ACF plot confirms that at lag 1, ACF is \( \phi_1 \), at lag 2, ACF is \( \phi_1^2 \), etc.

## Introduction to Moving Average (MA) Processes
- In MA models, \( Y_t \) is regressed on past error terms, instead of past values of \( Y_t \).
- General MA(q) Process:  
  \[
  Y_t = C + e_t + \theta_1 e_{t-1} + \theta_2 e_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q e_{t-q}
  \]
- Assumption: Error terms \( e_t \) are IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) with mean 0 and variance \( \sigma^2_e \).

## Properties of MA(q) Process
### Mean and Variance
- Mean Function:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[Y_t] = C
  \]
- Variance Function:  
  \[
  \sigma^2_Y = \sigma^2_e (1 + \theta_1^2 + \theta_2^2 + \dots + \theta_q^2)
  \]

### ACF of MA(1) Process
- For an MA(1) process:  
  \[
  Y_t = C + e_t + \theta_1 e_{t-1}
  \]
- ACF at lag 1:  
  \[
  \rho_1 = \frac{\theta_1}{1 + \theta_1^2}
  \]
- ACF for lags \( k > 1 \) is 0.

### ACF of MA(2) Process
- For MA(2) process:  
  \[
  Y_t = C + e_t + \theta_1 e_{t-1} + \theta_2 e_{t-2}
  \]
- ACF at lag 1:  
  \[
  \rho_1 = \frac{\theta_1 + \theta_1 \theta_2}{1 + \theta_1^2 + \theta_2^2}
  \]
- ACF at lag 2:  
  \[
  \rho_2 = \frac{\theta_2}{1 + \theta_1^2 + \theta_2^2}
  \]
- ACF for lags \( k > 2 \) is 0.

## General Property of MA(q) Processes
- The ACF of an MA(q) process is zero for all lags \( k > q \).
- This property distinguishes MA(q) from AR processes.

## Summary
- AR(1) process has an exponentially decaying ACF:  
  \[
  \rho_k = \phi_1^k
  \]
- MA(q) process has nonzero ACF up to lag \( q \) and is zero beyond \( q \).
- Simulation experiments verify theoretical results.
